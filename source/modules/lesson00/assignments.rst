Introduction
============
An important part of your success on this class is the work you do on
the class assignments. Here we describe the approach we are using for
saving and submitting your assignment work.

As with every part of Python 220 we are going to get as close as we can
to replicating the way that we work in a professional setting.

So now let's go through all of the steps.

Prior to starting, be sure you have your Git repo url from your instructor.

Part 1 - Setup
--------------
You will do this once, at the start of this course.
 We use exactly the same procedure as you used in course 1, but with a new
 repository.

See the Git setup page for more details.

Part 2 - Working on assignments
-------------------------------
For each lesson there is a directory for your assignment work. There also may
be a directory for activities (ungraded work) that are needed on some lessons.

Point your editor or IDE at the local repo directory from above. You will
see the directories for each lesson, and then in each lesson, the ones
for activities (ungraded) and the ones for assignments (which are graded).

You will also see a tests directory, that contains automated tests you can run
to verify if your assignment is complete and ready to submit.
You can also lint and run coverage tests, but we're getting to far ahead!

Remember to create a branch in which to do your work. Then, all you need to do is
save your work in the correct directory. Remember to commit often, with good
commit messages.

See the Git Workflow page for more details.

Part 3 - Submitting
-------------------
When you are ready to submit your work, push your working branch to the remote repo,
and then create a pull request for master, assigned to your instructor team.

And that's it!

Again, see the Git Workflw page for more details.
