Spend time using any of the modules or techniques referenced in this
lesson. The ones below are of particular interest. Please choose one to get ready to demo
to the class, or your instructor:

-  Explore code-only performance improvement strategies such as
   memoization.
-  Explore / demo cProfile side by side with PyCharm’s built-in profilers.
-  Explore / demo Python’s
   memory_profiler. \ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler
-  Use PyPy as the runtime interpreter for code developed by students
   during the curriculum.
-  Play with Cython and the Great Circle code!
-  Abandon Python’s math library and use \ ``cdef extern``\  to import
   and access C math functions into the Python code. (This vastly
   improves the performance of the Great Circle code!)
-  Dig into the compile and link steps required by Cython.
-  Work with setup files or any of the other methods to generate Cython
   libraries.\ http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html
-  Work with Cython
   profiling. \ http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html
-  Create a Makefile to manage the build (compile/link steps) for all
   the Cython code you’re
   generating. \ https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Once you've completed the activity from the lesson content, prepare to demo your work!
