In the lesson content, we asked you to spend 5-10 minutes on your own
debugging of the recursion error exercise code. Once you're finished, do the following:

#. In very general terms, use a couple of sentences to address the
   problem with our code. For example, give your best guess or insight
   on the following questions:

   -  What is wrong with our logic?
   -  Why doesn't the function stop calling itself?
   -  What's happening to the value of 'n' as the function gets deeper
      and deeper into recursion?

#. Include a copy-and-paste of your terminal debugging activity.

Demonstrating your workÂ 
=====================

Either bring your work to class or office hours, or show it to your instructor.
For example, you might produce:

::

    The function keeps calling itself and calling itself and it can't stop because
    it's a Tuesday today and Tuesdays are bad for recursion.

    Below is my debugging log:
    $ python -m pdb recursive.py
    > c/users/jschilz/onedrive/py300/debugging/recursive.py(1)<module>()
    -> import sys
    (Pdb) ll
     1 -> import sys
     2
     3
     4 def my_fun(n):
     5 if n == 2:
     6 return True
     7
     8 return my_fun(n/2)
     9
     10
     11 if __name__ == '__main__':
     12 n = int(sys.argv[1])
     13 print(my_fun(n))
    (Pdb) n
    > /users/jschilz/onedrive/py300/debugging/recursive.py(4)<module>()
    -> def my_fun(n):
    (Pdb)

Of course, your answer will be more insightful and your debugging log
will be longer.


Prepare the results, and prepare to demo them!
